### Built with

### What I learned
How to better use Flexbox and space things more evenly inside of a container, and how to add hover to elements outside of anchors

```css
.card {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: space-between;
}
h1:hover, h1:active {
    color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
    cursor: pointer;
}
```
